=========
RGI 6X6 TinyRover is a 6X6 skid steer platform the rgi has a X200 zoom camera mounted on a PT turret.
 ## Status
 * Visualization in Gazebo/Rviz is working
 * All interfaces are standard ROS  
 * An example launch file to run the GAZEBO simulation plus RVIZ and rqt interfaces.
		roslaunch rgi_gazebo rgi_gazebo_full_monti.launch
 ## Prior to running the lunch file for the 1st time:
 * Copy the meshes into the .gazebo models folder by executing the bash script 'setupRgiEnv.sh' found in \rgi\rgi_gazebo\scripts folder
		bash setupRgiEnv.sh
 * it is necessary to launch gazebo and load the 'Coke Can' model form the GAZEBO model data base then quit GAZEBO. That will make sure GAZEBO has  a local copy of the Coke Can model.
 Another option is to edit the launch file so it will load a different world that you know to work well on your setup. 

 * There are python scripts to demonstrate the operation of the RGI
  *  The joystick control script â€“ tested with a gamepad. The right stick drives the robot, the left stick drives the camera PT.
  * Keyboard control script -  drives the robot
 ## Joystick

 ## Keyboard
